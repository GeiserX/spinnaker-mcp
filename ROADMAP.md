# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for Spinnaker-MCP. The Spinnaker Gate API is extensive (~150+ endpoints across 60+ controllers), and this MCP server currently covers the highest-value operations. The roadmap is organized by priority and grouped by API domain.

## Current State (v0.3.0)

**37 tools** covering the core deployment workflow, pipeline lifecycle, and infrastructure visibility:

- Applications: list, get
- Pipelines: list, get config, trigger, save, update, delete, history
- Executions: list, get, search, cancel, pause, resume, restart stage, evaluate expression
- Strategies: list, save, delete
- Infrastructure: server groups, load balancers, clusters, scaling activities, target server groups, firewalls, instances, console output, images, image tags, networks, subnets, accounts
- Tasks: get status

**Authentication**: Bearer token, basic auth, x509 client certificates

**Transports**: stdio, Streamable HTTP

## Non-Goals

These are explicitly out of scope for this MCP server:

- **Replacing the Spinnaker UI (Deck)** — This server provides programmatic access for LLMs, not a full management interface
- **Direct cloud provider operations** — Spinnaker abstracts cloud providers; this server exposes Spinnaker's abstractions, not raw AWS/GCP/Azure APIs
- **Spinnaker installation or configuration** — Use Halyard/Operator/kleat for Spinnaker setup; this server consumes a running Gate
- **Multi-Gate routing** — Each MCP server instance connects to one Gate endpoint; run multiple instances for multiple Spinnaker deployments

---

## Contributing

Contributions toward any roadmap item are welcome. If you're planning to work on a larger feature (Phase 4+), please open an issue first to discuss the approach.

Priority is given to features that benefit the most common Spinnaker workflows: pipeline management, deployment monitoring, and canary analysis.
